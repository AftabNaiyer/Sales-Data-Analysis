### **6. Regional Sales Analysis**
- **Top Performing Locations:** Cities/regions with the highest sales contributions.
- **Low-Performing Areas:** Identified underperforming locations and potential reasons (demographics, competition, etc.).
- **Geo-Heat Map Visualization:** Used Power BI maps to visually display revenue distribution.

## 📚 Dataset Overview
### **Tables Used**
- **Sales Data:** Contains transaction details including date, product ID, customer ID, quantity, price, and revenue.
- **Customers:** Stores customer information such as name, location, and purchase frequency.
- **Products:** Includes product details like name, category, cost, and profit margin.
- **Regions:** Provides geographical sales distribution.

### **Key Metrics & Measures (DAX)**
- **Total Revenue** = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
- **Total Profit** = SUM(Sales[Revenue]) - SUM(Sales[Cost])
- **Profit Margin** = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Revenue], 0)
- **Average Order Value** = AVERAGE(Sales[Revenue])
- **Customer Retention Rate** = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[CustomerID]), Sales[Repeat Customer] = TRUE)
- **Total Orders** = COUNT(Sales[OrderID])
- **Average Discount by Category** = AVERAGEX(FILTER(Sales, Sales[Discount] > 0), Sales[Discount])

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Power BI** for data visualization and interactive dashboards.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for custom calculations and data modeling.
- **Excel/CSV** as the data source.
